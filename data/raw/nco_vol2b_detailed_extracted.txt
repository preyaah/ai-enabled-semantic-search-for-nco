FOREWORD
National Classification of Occupation (NCO) plays a very vital role in maintaining
standards of occupation in the country and is regularly used in the network of employment
exchanges that constitute the Public Employment Service for Classification of Occupations,
job postings and job search. This classification is used in all types of censuses and sample
surveys conducted in India especially in data collection, processing, analysis and presentation
of survey results besides its wide range of applications in policy formulation and policy
analysis. The Directorate General of Employment, Ministry of Labour & Employment,
Government of India is responsible for maintaining and updating the National Classification
of Occupation in India aligned with the corresponding International Standard Classification of
Occupations (ISCO) of ILO. The first classification was NC0-1946 followed by NC0-1958, NC0-
1968, NC0-2004 and now the current series NC0-2015. The National Classification of
Occupations-2015 (NC0-2015) is aligned with International Standard Classification of
Occupations-2008 (ISC0-2008).
2. NCO is a classification of occupations which describes and assigns codes to the various
occupations in the country and aligns it with the ISCO. These codes are reviewed and updated
periodically to reflect developments in the labour market, particularly with the emergence of
new occupations, as well as to align with changes in the international standard. These codes
also help in promoting international comparability of statistical data relating to occupations.
These occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical approach having major,
minor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the years to capture the
structural changes in the employment market and current work practices and work
environment.
3. The NC0-2015 is a compendium for occupational information available in the Indian
economy. The document gives an insight into the occupational framework, nature of duties
involved and the level of skill requirement to perform the activities in a real time work
situation. The users of NCO may make use of the information for vocational guidance, career
counselling and various surveys and studies undertaken by user agencies. The NC0-2015 has
also been mapped with the National Industrial Classification (NIC) and Qualification Packs
National Occupational Standards (QP-NOS) to cater to the structural changes in the labour
market. Furthermore, NC0-2015 framework is dynamic enough to capture and reflect the
newly emerging occupations in the industry.
4. The current volume of NCO details out the job description of 3600 civilian occupations
covering 52 sectors, as compared to the earlier series of NCO i.e. NC0-2004, which contained
the job descriptions for 2945 occupations. The NC0-2015 has 8 digit coding structure which
was mapped and aligned to ISC0-2008 with the addition of 2 digits. There is one to one
correspondence between ISC0-2008 and the NC0-2015 with the first digit representing the
Division (Major GroupL second digit representing Sub-Division (Sub-Major GroupL third digit
representing the Group (Minor Group) and the fourth digit representing the Family (Unit
GroupL a decimal is introduced after the first four digits in order to create a distinction
between the Families and individual Occupations. The NC0-2015 is in two Volumes viz. Vol I
& II (A& B) where Vol I gives the abstract of Occupations along with their concordance to the
earlier NC0-2004. Vol II gives the detailed descriptions ofthe occupations.

5. The Ministry is implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a Mission
Mode Project for modernising and transforming the network of employment exchanges and
Model Career Centres are being set up in collaboration with States. The NCS Portal is
operational at www.ncs.gov.in and aims to link job seekers with employment opportunities
along with rich career content. The NCO Codes are integrally enmeshed in the NCS initiative
and facilitates efficient job matching. The NCO Codes may be used by varied stakeholders in
making information in the employment market more transparent and objective. Soft copies
of the publication is available on the NCS portal.
6. The NC0-2015 series has been evolved along with career content to contribute to the
knowledge repository of career options. More details on the classification, as well as the
principles, scope and structure of the classification are available on the National Career
Service (www.ncs.gov.in) platform. This knowledge repository provides career related
information for use by career counsellors and job aspirants across the country and aims at
supporting policy makers, students, job seekers, persons returning to the labour force,
investors and employers in making better labour market decisions.
7. I am confident that the publication will prove useful in classifying occupations for
official work, survey and research work, international comparisons on the demand and supply
of workforce and many more such areas. I place on record my appreciation for all the
stakeholders who have contributed their valuable inputs in the publication. I also take this
opportunity to extend my thanks to the members of the Expert Group on the career content
who have examined and vetted the contents of this publication/documents. I also extend my
thanks to the officers of the Directorate lead by Mr. Pravin Srivastava, Deputy Director
General (Employment) for timely coordination with all the stakeholders involved in this
initiative.

Subject: Release of the National Classification of Occupation (NCO), 2015 series.
Dear Secretary,
The Directorate General of Employment (DGE) is responsible for revising and
maintaining the National Classification of Occupations (NCO) on the lines of International
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) of the ILO. The codes are used for classification
of occupations by the employment exchanges and census/survey organisations of the
Central and State government. These codes are revised from time to time to capture the
changes in occupational patterns and structural changes in the economy. The codes also
help in promoting International comparability of statistical data relating to occupations. The
first set of occupation standards (ISCO) was brought out by the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) in 1958 and revised from time to time, the latest being the 2008 series.
The corresponding series in the Indian National Classification of Occupation (NCO) were
1958, 1967 and 2004. These occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical
approach having major, minor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the
years to capture the structural changes in the employment market. The NCO codes are
extensively used by the employment exchanges and other data/survey collection agencies
like the Ministry of Statistics & PI (NSSO, CSO), Census Commissioner & RGI, NITI Aayog,
IAMR, State Governments, Academic Institutions etc.
2. The current national series (NC0-2004) was based on the ISC0-1988 series and
required updation to capture information on the new occupations that have emerged,
especially on account of liberalisation and globalisation. In the meanwhile, the Ministry
began implementing the National Career Service as a Mission Mode Project for modernising
and transforming the network of employment exchanges and 100 Model Career Centres are
being set up in collaboration with States. The NCS Portal is operational at www.ncs.gov.in
and aims to link job seekers with employment opportunities along with rich career content.

The NCO Codes are integrally enmeshed in the NCS initiative and facilitates efficient job
matching. The NCO - 2015 code is in 2 volumes, the first giving the abstract occupations
along with their concordance to the earlier NC0-2004 series and the second volume giving
the detailed occupational description. A hard copy of the first volume is enclosed for ready
reference. It is requested that the NCO Codes may be used by all stakeholders in making
information in the employment market more transparent and objective. Soft copies of these
publications are available on the attached CD and also on the NCS portal.
3. I request that information about the publication be circulated to the various
Departments and other users and its usage may be ensured by sending various statistical
returns using these revised codes. We look forward to suggestions for improvement in the
NCO codes and these may kindly be sent at feedback.dget@nic.in.
