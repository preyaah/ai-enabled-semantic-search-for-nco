FOREWORD
National Classification of Occupation (NCO) plays a very vital role in maintaining
standards of occupation in the country and is regularly used in the network of employment
exchanges that constitute the Public Employment Service for Classification of Occupations,
job postings and job search. This classification is used in all types of censuses and sample
surveys conducted in India especially in data collection, processing, analysis and presentation
of survey results besides its wide range of applications in policy formulation and policy
analysis. The Directorate General of Employment, Ministry of Labour & Employment,
Government of India is responsible for maintaining and updating the National Classification
of Occupation in India aligned with the corresponding International Standard Classification of
Occupations (ISCO) of ILO. The first classification was NC0-1946 followed by NC0-1958, NC0-
1968, NC0-2004 and now the current series NC0-2015. The National Classification of
Occupations-2015 (NC0-2015) is aligned with International Standard Classification of
Occupations-2008 (ISC0-2008).
2. NCO is a classification of occupations which describes and assigns codes to the various
occupations in the country and aligns it with the ISCO. These codes are reviewed and updated
periodically to reflect developments in the labour market, particularly with the emergence of
new occupations, as well as to align with changes in the international standard. These codes
also help in promoting international comparability of statistical data relating to occupations.
These occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical approach having major,
minor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the years to capture the
structural changes in the employment market and current work practices and work
environment.
3. The NC0-2015 is a compendium for occupational information available in the Indian
economy. The document gives an insight into the occupational framework, nature of duties
involved and the level of skill requirement to perform the activities in a real time work
situation. The users of NCO may make use of the information for vocational guidance, career
counselling and various surveys and studies undertaken by user agencies. The NC0-2015 has
also been mapped with the National Industrial Classification (NIC) and Qualification Packs
National Occupational Standards (QP-NOS) to cater to the structural changes in the labour
market. Furthermore, NC0-2015 framework is dynamic enough to capture and reflect the
newly emerging occupations in the industry.
4. The current volume of NCO details out the job description of 3600 civilian occupations
covering 52 sectors, as compared to the earlier series of NCO i.e. NC0-2004, which contained
the job descriptions for 2945 occupations. The NC0-2015 has 8 digit coding structure which
was mapped and aligned to ISC0-2008 with the addition of 2 digits. There is one to one
correspondence between ISC0-2008 and the NC0-2015 with the first digit representing the
Division (Major GroupL second digit representing Sub-Division (Sub-Major GroupL third digit
representing the Group (Minor Group) and the fourth digit representing the Family (Unit
GroupL a decimal is introduced after the first four digits in order to create a distinction
between the Families and individual Occupations. The NC0-2015 is in two Volumes viz. Vol I
& II (A& B) where Vol I gives the abstract of Occupations along with their concordance to the
earlier NC0-2004. Vol II gives the detailed descriptions ofthe occupations.

5. The Ministry is implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a Mission
Mode Project for modernising and transforming the network of employment exchanges and
Model Career Centres are being set up in collaboration with States. The NCS Portal is
operational at www.ncs.gov.in and aims to link job seekers with employment opportunities
along with rich career content. The NCO Codes are integrally enmeshed in the NCS initiative
and facilitates efficient job matching. The NCO Codes may be used by varied stakeholders in
making information in the employment market more transparent and objective. Soft copies
of the publication is available on the NCS portal.
6. The NC0-2015 series has been evolved along with career content to contribute to the
knowledge repository of career options. More details on the classification, as well as the
principles, scope and structure of the classification are available on the National Career
Service (www.ncs.gov.in) platform. This knowledge repository provides career related
information for use by career counsellors and job aspirants across the country and aims at
supporting policy makers, students, job seekers, persons returning to the labour force,
investors and employers in making better labour market decisions.
7. I am confident that the publication will prove useful in classifying occupations for
official work, survey and research work, international comparisons on the demand and supply
of workforce and many more such areas. I place on record my appreciation for all the
stakeholders who have contributed their valuable inputs in the publication. I also take this
opportunity to extend my thanks to the members of the Expert Group on the career content
who have examined and vetted the contents of this publication/documents. I also extend my
thanks to the officers of the Directorate lead by Mr. Pravin Srivastava, Deputy Director
General (Employment) for timely coordination with all the stakeholders involved in this
initiative.

Subject: Release of the National Classification of Occupation (NCO), 2015 series.
Dear Secretary,
The Directorate General of Employment (DGE) is responsible for revising and
maintaining the National Classification of Occupations (NCO) on the lines of International
Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) of the ILO. The codes are used for classification
of occupations by the employment exchanges and census/survey organisations of the
Central and State government. These codes are revised from time to time to capture the
changes in occupational patterns and structural changes in the economy. The codes also
help in promoting International comparability of statistical data relating to occupations. The
first set of occupation standards (ISCO) was brought out by the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) in 1958 and revised from time to time, the latest being the 2008 series.
The corresponding series in the Indian National Classification of Occupation (NCO) were
1958, 1967 and 2004. These occupational standards follow a scientific and hierarchical
approach having major, minor and unit groups of classification which has evolved over the
years to capture the structural changes in the employment market. The NCO codes are
extensively used by the employment exchanges and other data/survey collection agencies
like the Ministry of Statistics & PI (NSSO, CSO), Census Commissioner & RGI, NITI Aayog,
IAMR, State Governments, Academic Institutions etc.
2. The current national series (NC0-2004) was based on the ISC0-1988 series and
required updation to capture information on the new occupations that have emerged,
especially on account of liberalisation and globalisation. In the meanwhile, the Ministry
began implementing the National Career Service as a Mission Mode Project for modernising
and transforming the network of employment exchanges and 100 Model Career Centres are
being set up in collaboration with States. The NCS Portal is operational at www.ncs.gov.in
and aims to link job seekers with employment opportunities along with rich career content.

The NCO Codes are integrally enmeshed in the NCS initiative and facilitates efficient job
matching. The NCO - 2015 code is in 2 volumes, the first giving the abstract occupations
along with their concordance to the earlier NC0-2004 series and the second volume giving
the detailed occupational description. A hard copy of the first volume is enclosed for ready
reference. It is requested that the NCO Codes may be used by all stakeholders in making
information in the employment market more transparent and objective. Soft copies of these
publications are available on the attached CD and also on the NCS portal.
3. I request that information about the publication be circulated to the various
Departments and other users and its usage may be ensured by sending various statistical
returns using these revised codes. We look forward to suggestions for improvement in the
NCO codes and these may kindly be sent at feedback.dget@nic.in.

National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
INTRODUCTION TO CLASSIFICATION OF OCCUPATIONS
Classification group organizes information meaningfully and systematically into a standard
format that is useful for determining the similarity of ideas, events, objects or persons. The
preparation of a classification group means the creation of an exhaustive and structured set of
mutually exclusive and well-described categories often presented as a hierarchy that is reflected
by the numeric or alphabetical codes assigned to them.
Classification of occupation is used in the national context for the collection and dissemination of
statistics from sources such as population censuses, labour market surveys, employer surveys,
and other sources. It is also used by the Government and other organizations in activities such as
administration of workerâs compensation, matching jobseekers with job vacancies, and
management of employment-related migration.
The classification of occupation is a categorization of individual occupations on the kind of work
and skill-level involved in that particular occupation. It is intended that all the job titles in the
nation can be assigned to one (and only one) of these categories or codes.

National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF OCCUPATION IN INDIA: 1946 TO 2015
1.1 National Classification of Occupations (NCO) 1946
The first effort in the direction of preparing an occupational classification system in India was
made by the then Directorate General of Resettlement and Employment, DGRE (later called the
Directorate General of Employment and Training (DGE&T) and now referred to as Directorate
General of Training (DGT) ) in 1946 in bringing out a publication titled âGuide to Occupational
Classificationâ primarily to be used by employment service for day-to-day work at the
Employment Exchanges such as registration of applicants, documentation of vacancies,
compilation of statistical data, etc. It was an industrial-based classification and was framed after
the British pattern.
1.2 National Classification of Occupations (NCO) 1958
International Labour Organization (ILO) brought out the first International Standard Classification
of Occupations (ISCO) in 1958 with a view to bring out a complete occupational classification
system, which could help in promoting international comparability of statistical data relating to
occupations.
DGE&T accordingly took up the work of preparing an NCO on the lines of ISCO and brought out
âNational Classifications of Occupations â 1958â.
NCO â 1958 contained detailed information about 1990 occupations in the following hierarchical
pattern:
11 Occupational Divisions (one digit code number)
75 Occupational Groups (two digit code number)
331 Occupational Families (three digit code number)
1990 Occupations (five digit code number)
VOLUME I 2
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
1.3 National Classification of Occupations (NCO) 1968
Both the ILO and the DGE&T continued to work for the improvement of their respective
classification systems. The ILO introduced a number of changes in the ISCO â 58 viz. called it ISCO
â 66, applied the principle of âtype of work performedâ more rigidly, and revised the Major,
Minor, and Unit Groups (corresponding to NCO Divisions, Groups, and Families) of the
classification. In order to ensure that NCO â 68 is compatible with ISCO â 66, DGE&T revised the
code structure so that the new NCO, called NCO â 68, would be patterned after the ISCO â 66.
While adopting the ISCO â 66 code structure, deviations were made, wherever necessary, to suit
the Indian conditions and settings.
This edition attempted to group together occupations according to similarity of work performed
and contained information about 2484 occupations on the following hierarchical pattern:
8 Occupational Divisions (one digit code number)
95 Occupational Groups (two digit code number)
462 Occupational Families (three digit code number)
2484 Occupations (five digit code number)
This was a 5 digit classification system, which gave a unique title to every occupation (called the
Standard Title) and in some cases alternative titles have also been given. This classification gave
definitions of the occupations, a brief outline of the main tasks, and functions of each occupation
thus bringing out the difference between one occupation and another.
In this classification system, the grouping of occupations was based on the fundamental criteria
of âtype of work performedâ. Accordingly, occupations were classified in the NCO â 68 so that all
the workers engaged in the same type of work are grouped together irrespective of the industrial
classification of establishments where they are engaged. For example, all clerical workers have
been classified in one occupational group whether they are engaged in a factory, mine,
VOLUME I 3
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
government office or even a shop. Similarly, drivers have been grouped together, and so are
those engaged in services.
The branch of economic activity (industry), in which a job occurs, did not affect the classification
of occupations in the NCO â 68.
However, this classification system did not take into account the skill involved in the performance
of various occupations. This means, in effect, that occupations having similar nature of work,
though requiring varied levels of skill for their performance, were grouped together.
1.4 National Classification of Occupations (NCO) 2004
After a gap of about 3 decades the NCO â 04 was brought out. During this period, the economic,
social, industrial, and agrarian fields underwent drastic changes. Globalization and economic
liberalization had infused competitiveness amongst various industries. This led to changes in the
work process and skill level of the workers. This also brought in a totally new class of jobs and
functions.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) revised ISCO â 66 on the recommendation of the
International Conference of Labour Statisticians and brought out ISCO â 88. It was developed to
facilitate international comparisons of occupational statistics and to serve as a model for
countries developing or revising their national occupational classifications. The ILO came out with
a new version wherein not only the work performed, but also the skill level required was
considered in the codification of occupations.
ISCO â 88 had three main aims namely:
i. To facilitate international communication about occupations by supplying national
statisticians with a tool to make national occupational data available internationally
VOLUME I 4
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
ii. To make it possible for international occupational data to be produced in a form that can
be useful for research as well as for specific decision-making and action-oriented
activities. These activities could connect with international migration or job placement.
iii. To serve as a model for countries developing or revising their national occupational
classifications. However, ISCO â 88 was not intended to replace any existing national
classification of occupations as the occupational classification systems of different
countries was required to reflect the structure of their individual national labour markets.
The framework necessary for designing and constructing ISCO â 88 was created in such a way
that it not only defined the kind of work performed, but also the skill required to perform that
particular job effectively.
A âjobâ has been defined as a set of tasks and duties performed by one person and an
âoccupationâ as a set of jobs whose tasks and duties are of a similar nature.
âSkillâ has been defined as the ability to carry out the tasks and duties of a given job, which
encompasses two dimensions namely:
i. Skill Level: A function that describes the range of the tasks and duties involved
ii. Skill Specialization: Shows the field of knowledge required, the tools and machinery used,
the materials worked on, and the kinds of goods and services produced
In view of the international character of the classification, only four, broad skill levels were used.
This classification of skill levels was more or less based on the educational categories and levels,
which appear in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). It is also worth
keeping in view that the focus was on the skills required to carry out the tasks and duties of an
occupation and not on whether a worker working in a particular occupation is more or less skilled
than another worker in the same occupation.
VOLUME I 5
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction

technical, and procedural knowledge in a specialized field
IV Typically involves the performance of tasks that require Post-Graduate
complex problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity University
based on an extensive body of theoretical and factual Degree
knowledge in a specialized field
The ISCO â 88 had the following hierarchical structure:
1. Major Groups: 10
2. Sub-Major Groups: 28
3. Minor Groups: 116
4. Unit Groups: 390
The ten Major Groups in ISCO â 88 are:
1. Legislators, Senior Officials, and Managers
2. Professionals
3. Technicians & Associate Professionals
4. Clerks
5. Service Workers and Shop and Market Sales Workers
6. Skilled Agricultural and Fishery Workers
7. Craft and Related Trades Workers
8. Plant and Machinery Operators and Assemblers
VOLUME I 6
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
9. Elementary Occupations
10. Armed Forces
Significantly, the concept of skill level has not been applied in the case of legislators, senior
officials, and managers based on information from national sources. Skills for executing task and
duties of these occupations vary to such an extent that it is not feasible to link them with any of
the four, broad ISCO â 88 skill levels.
1.4.1 Revision of NCO 1968 to NCO 2004
The exercise on Revision of NCO â 1968 was undertaken by DGE&T through State Directorates of
Employment and Vocational Rehabilitation Centres for Handicapped under the aegis of the
DGE&T.
A core group comprising technical committee called the Steering Committee was formed having
members drawn from the various organizations like government bodies, ministries, universities,
and research institutes.
The Steering Committee recommended that a Core Group maybe formed to constantly guide and
advise the DGE&T study team in their work. Accordingly, a Core Group was set-up having
members drawn from the following organizations:
1. Directorate General of Employment & Training (DGE&T)
2. Central Statistical Organization
3. National Sample Survey Organization
4. Registrar General of India
5. Department of Small Scale Industries
6. State Director of Employment, NCT, Delhi
7. State Director of Employment, Andhra Pradesh
A job analysis schedule was designed for collection of occupational information from various
sources. The schedule was designed on the basis of occupational and educational information
VOLUME I 7
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
available through the reports on Occupational Educational Pattern of Employees published under
the Employment Market Information (EMI) programme of the DGE&T and other relevant sources.
The job analysis schedule was designed to cover all aspects of an occupation. For the convenience
of the job analysts, and to maintain uniformity, detailed guidelines for filling the job analysis
schedules and highlighting the steps involved for collecting data for each item were specified in
the schedule. Most of the officers who were put on the job of collection of occupational
information on the job analysis schedules were drawn from EMI Units and VRCs where collection
of occupational information forms are a regular feature of their jobs.
The job analysis schedule was pre-tested in six states namely Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat through the six Vocational Rehabilitation Centres for
Handicapped (VRCs) functioning in these states. The data collected by the VRCs was analysed and
the details about the same occupations coming from different VRCs were cross-checked. The
schedule was then finalized and approved by the Core Group for adoption in the field.
Employment Exchanges and Vocational Rehabilitation Centres collect labour market information
so as to know about newly emerging areas and those going out of existence so that the
jobseekers can be guided for gainful activities such as self-employment, etc.
1.4.2 NCO 2004 Methodology
Since the primary source of collecting information is the âestablishmentâ, it was necessary to
ensure the widest coverage of the establishments. To achieve this wide coverage, following
knowledge/information repositories were considered:
i. Employersâ register maintained by the National Employment Service for their Employment
Market Information Programme
ii. Lists of employers organizations
iii. List of establishments compiled by NSSO for conducting Annual Survey of Industries, etc.
The final framework was prepared by the Employment Market Information Units, which is as
follows:
VOLUME I 8
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
The Employment Market Information Units were asked to update their employersâ registers by
utilizing the data available from various sources like:
1. List of establishments compiled by NSSO for conducting annual survey of industries
2. Consultation with websites hoisted by corporate sector
3. Consultation with private placement agencies to the extent possible
4. Utilization of records maintained by various offices of state governments such as the ones
maintained by:
ï· The office of Inspector of Shops & Establishments
ï· The office of Chief Inspector of Factories
ï· The office of Inspector of Schools
ï· The office of Local Mines Inspector
ï· The office of District Industries Officer
ï· The office of District Treasury Officer
ï· Records from the Small Industries Service Institute
ï· Employersâ Associations, etc.
1.4.3 Coverage of Unorganized Sector
Unorganised sector was also covered by the VRCs during the course of job development work,
particularly under the community-based rehabilitation programme in which the main thrust was
on identifying occupations in the non-formal sector.
1.4.4 Collection Through Secondary Sources
In addition to information collected by the job analysts through sample survey, efforts were
made to collect data through various secondary sources like all the national and major regional
newspapers, leading magazines, and the Internet.
Occupational classification systems of other countries were also consulted to locate newly
emerging occupations which have a relevance to the Indian conditions. Apart from this, other
VOLUME I 9
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
organizations like RGI, CSO, NSSO, etc. also provided very useful inputs that served valuable for
deciding on new occupations.
1.4.5 Co-Ordination and Liaising
Since a large number of officers belonging to various agencies were involved in the whole
exercise, co-ordination and liaising between various agencies was achieved firstly through
distribution of the detailed Manual of Procedure on Revision of NCO to each and every officer
involved in the process. Secondly, constant touch through correspondence, telephone, fax, and e-
mail, etc. was maintained by the DGE&T study team with all those involved in the exercise. The
field analysts were encouraged to get even the slightest doubts cleared.
1.4.6 Processing of the Job Analysis Schedules
A large volume of data thus collected became available at DGE&T Headquarters, which was
classified according to NIC codes. The job descriptions of the same occupation received from
different sources were edited and consolidated to have an average picture of the job duties of
the occupation. These average pictures were then compared with the job descriptions of the
existing occupations to identify new occupations. Duplication was taken care out to ensure
inclusion of only new occupations.
1.4.7 Skill Level
Before codifying all the occupations on the pattern of ISCO â 88, the skill levels as defined in the
ISCED were modified to suit the Indian conditions taking particular cognizance of informal skill. In
the Indian context, the skills necessary to perform the tasks and duties of a given job can be
acquired not only through formal education but also through informal training and experience.
The four skill levels thus defined for NCO â 04 vis-Ã -vis the skill levels defined in ISCO â 88 are as
given below:
Skill Level ISCO â 88 Educational NCO â 2004 Educational Requirements
Requirements

skills
II Secondary Education 11-13 years of formal education
III First University Degree 14-15 years of formal education
IV Post-Graduate University More than 15 years of formal education
Degree
The skill level of each newly identified occupation was decided on the basis of information about
academic and technical qualifications and experience requirement as also the average job
description of the occupation to see whether the job requirement was of administrative,
managerial, and supervisory nature or of a subordinate/repetitive nature in the Indian context.
In keeping with the skill levels defined above to suit the Indian conditions, following divisions
were classified in tune with the defined skill levels to accommodate occupations:

VOLUME I 11
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
* The concept of skill level was not applied in the case of legislators, senior officials, and managers
as skills for executing task and duties of these occupations varied to such an extent that it was not
be feasible to link them with any of the four, broad skill levels.
1.4.8 Levels of Aggregation
In keeping with the pattern of classification of occupations adopted in ISCO â 88, it was decided
to have one more level of aggregation between Division and Group called Sub-Division. The
nomenclature for different levels of aggregation is as under:
NCO â 68 ISCO â 88 NCO â 2004
DIVISION MAJOR GROUP DIVISION
GROUP SUB-MAJOR GROUP SUB-DIVISION
FAMILY MINOR GROUP GROUP
- - - UNIT GROUP FAMILY
OCCUPATION - - - - - -
- - - - - - OCCUPATION
1.4.9 Finalization and Codification
The focus in NCO â 2004 was on the skills required to carry out the tasks and duties of an
occupation and not on whether the worker holding a particular occupation was more skilled than
another worker in the same occupation. In case of multi-skill occupations, the coding was done
on the basis of the predominant skill required to perform the tasks in a job role.
All the 2945 Occupations (both existing and newly identified) were grouped together according to
combinations of specific duties, tasks, and work functions. They were grouped in such a way that
the job roles performed were the same or closely related. Each occupation was assigned a six
digit code, a distinct title (in some cases alternative titles have also been provided), and a
definition.
VOLUME I 12
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
NCO 2004 Code Structure Number of Units Six Digits Code Number Denoted by
Division 10 Initial single digit code number
Sub-Division 30 First two digits of code number
Group 116 First three digits of code number
Family 439 First four digits of code number
Occupations 2945 Last two decimal digits of the code
number
The occupations have been first assigned to the ten Occupational Divisions (identified by the
initial digit in the code number) on the basis of their job description. The first code indicates the
Division in which the job falls under. The first and second code indicates the Sub-Division under
which the job role falls. The first three digits make up the Group of the job role, and the first four
digits together make the Family under which the job role is categorized. The last two digits
indicate the unique code for that particular job role. Disaggregation after Family have been made
to accommodate initially up to nine âtwo digitâ codes within each Family keeping a provision for
accommodating up to 99 Occupations in each Family.
In a Family, the relation between occupations was determined by the similarity of characteristics
of work done and the level of skill. The most important feature of a Family was that the
Occupations included were closely related to each other than to Occupations outside the Family.
The last two digits of the code numbers for the individual Occupations within a Family were
numbered in sequence, usually leaving intervals of 5 or 10 between numbers depending on the
number of Occupations to be accommodated within the Family. This also left a scope for
accommodating any new Occupations that maybe identified later without disturbing the basic
code structure. Shorter intervals between the code numbers of two consecutive Occupations
VOLUME I 13
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
were kept to denote the close proximity of the nature of work of the two Occupations whereas
larger intervals would denote dissimilarity of the nature of work of the two Occupations. A period
(.) separates the final two digits from the code number of the Family.
The revision of NCO â 2004 was carried out in line with the approach adopted by ILO in its ISCO â
88. As such, all the Unit Groups in ISCO â 88 were adopted as Families at 4 digit level, even
though in some cases no Occupations at the specified skill level were identified so far. This was
done to accommodate Occupations, which may become available in the near future.
Owing to introduction of the concept of skill level and new aggregation at six digit level in the
NCO â 2004 classification, the code structure was radically changed. This resulted into breaking
up and/or merger of some Divisions, Groups, and Families of the 1968 version. Due to this, exact
equivalents of all the codes in the 68 version may not be available.
As in the earlier editions, separate codes were not provided for apprentices, foremen, and
instructors (in-plant). These maybe classified by prefixing âAâ, âBâ or âCâ respectively before the
code number of the occupation which is being learned, supervised or instructed.

National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
2. National Classification of Occupations â 2015
Globalization of the labour market has increased the demand for internationally comparable
occupational data for both statistical and administrative purposes. In India, there is a huge gap
between jobseekers and job providers, training institutions, and related industries. In the last ten
years, there has been a sea of change in almost all the sectors as most jobs have become
mechanized or computerized. These changes need to reflect in the NCO as well. Therefore, the
first step to achieve the vision of connecting youth with job opportunities was to create a fresh
new repository of occupations.
In 2015, Training wing of DGE&T has become a part of the Ministry of Skills Development and
Entrepreneurship whereas the Employment wing is responsible for NCO â 2015.
The main objectives of updating the NCO are:
ï· To create a useful model for the development of National Classifications of Occupations
(NCO)
ï· To make NCO â 2015 compatible to ISCO â 2008 so that it is relevant for international
reporting, comparisons, and exchange of statistical and administrative information about
occupations
2.1 Need for Revision
Currently, the employability and vocational skills upgradation sectors in India are undergoing a
paradigm shift. The dynamics and outlook towards labour is increasingly becoming market-
responsive and driven by constantly evolving needs. Simultaneously, the employment
aspirational quotient and needs of individuals who seek employment have already evolved and
are closely aligned with global trends and factors. Aligning to these factors and requirements, the
DGE&T has envisioned a multidimensional approach for evolution.
DGE&T envisaged aligning and upgrading NCO â 2004 using the guided baseline provided by ISCO
â 2008. The need for this revision was to get accurate data from the market along with research
into sectors/industries and to identify the size and profile of the sectors/industries, types of
occupations, key trends, developments, and opportunities for progression.
VOLUME I 15
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
Todayâs ease of connectivity with the world and access to technology has made information
available to one and all. It is important therefore that all those who seek employment be
connected to those who provide it, and sustain them in employment. To address this element,
DGE&T created a central portal that will cross-connect the employee to the employer. This portal,
after revision of the NCO, will have relevant and comparative information that will assist
potential jobseekers to understand, evaluate, and decide on a suitable career entry.
2.2 Mapping the QP NOS to the Job Roles in NCO â 2015
In India, general education and vocational education training have been operating as separate
verticals with little interaction between the two. In order to facilitate mobility from vocational to
general education, and vice-versa, a national qualification framework was developed.
The National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) was brought out by National Skill
Development Agency. NSQF is based on an outcome-based approach and each level in the NSQF
is defined and described in terms of competency levels that need to be achieved. The job roles
corresponding to each of these competency levels would be ascertained with the involvement of
the industry through the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs).
The use of NSQF will make it easier for the institutes, students, and employers to pursue a
particular course and address the issues of inequity and disparity in qualifications. As a
competency-based and outcome-based qualification framework, NSQF will facilitate Recognition
of Prior Learning (RPL). NSQF will also help to align Indian qualifications to international
qualifications.
The National Occupational Standards (NOS) is one of the most important contributions of the
National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) to the skills environment of India. This was done
in affiliation with the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). The SSCs are the national partnership
organization with NSDC that bring together all the stakeholders â industry, labour, and the
academia.
VOLUME I 16
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
NOS defines the measurable performance outcomes required from an individual engaged in a
particular task. NOS lists down what an individual should know and do while performing a
particular task.
The SSCs play a pivotal role in linking the gap between what the industry wants and what should
be the curriculum for a skilling programme. One of the functions of the SSC is developing skill
competency standards and qualifications, which form the National Occupational Standards (NOS).
Essentially NOS are benchmarks of good practice. The set of NOS for a job role is called a QP or
Qualification Packs. The Government has clearly stated that the SSCs will provide their sector-
specific competency frameworks or Qualification Packs, which help in both the creation of
curriculum and assessments.
As the NCO is a comprehensive repository for national occupations, all the QPs released by the
various sector/industries through NSDC are mapped to the job roles in the NCO â 2015. A QP NOS
in the NCO â 2015 is aligned to a job role wherever an exact match is found. A new job role was
added to the NCO where there was no description of a job role specified as per a given QP NOS.
Thus, all the QPs released by the various SSCs are mapped and added during the creation of NCO
â 2015. The NCO â 2015 would be updated as and when new QPs are released by the SSCs. The
Employment wing of DGE&T will undertake any alignment of QP NOS to NCO â2015 in the future.
2.3 Outline of the Revision Exercise
A five step approach was followed to update the existing NCO â 2004. The exercise was to align
the job roles in NCO â 2004 to ISCO â 2008 and also map the job roles to various sectors and
industries along with the existing NIC â 2008. The NCO job roles were also classified into jobs that
were relevant, needed any modification or were completely obsolete. The Qualification Packs
(QP) released by National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) were also mapped to the NCO â
2015 job roles.
VOLUME I 17
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
The five steps approach is:
1. Aligning existing NCO â 2004 to ISCO â 2008 to create NCO â 2015
2. Mapping the QPs to the job roles in NCO â 2015
3. Coding the NCO â 2015 job roles
4. Mapping the job roles to the sectors/industry
5. Mapping the job roles to NIC â 2008
6. Classifying the job roles as relevant, relevant with modification, and obsolete
2.4 Aligning NCO â 2015 to ISCO â 2008
While aligning NCO â 2004 to ISCO â 2008, it was noticed that a number of completely new Sub-
Major Groups, Minor Groups, and Unit Groups have been introduced to ISCO â 2008. This led to a
total revamp of Groups and Families in NCO â 2015. Many existing Families were either split or
merged into different Families.
The changes thus made showed that NCO â 2004 was out of date in some areas as a result of the
impact of development in technology as many jobs now depended on the use of computers and
telecommunications. Thus, the merger or spilt of Families reflected occupational and
technological change in the current labour market.
During the mapping exercise, the nature of work performed has been given more emphasis than
the formal education in determining the skill level of the occupation.
Skill Level ISCO â 08 Educational Requirements NCO â 2015 Educational Requirements
I Primary Education Up to 10 years of formal education and/or
informal skills
II Secondary Education 11-13 years of formal education
III First University Degree 14-15 years of formal education
IV Post-Graduate University Degree More than 15 years of formal education
VOLUME I 18
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
The skill level of each newly identified Occupation was decided on the basis of information about
academic and technical qualifications and experience requirement as also the average job
description of the occupation to see whether the job requirement was of administrative,
managerial, supervisory nature or of a subordinate/repetitive nature in the Indian context.
In keeping with the skill levels defined above to suit Indian conditions, following Divisions were
classified in tune with the defined skill levels to accommodate Occupations:
NCO 2015 Title Skill Level
Divisions
1 Legislators, Senior Officials, and Managers Not Defined*
2 Professionals IV
3 Associate Professionals III
4 Clerks II
5 Service Workers and Shop & Market Sales Workers II
6 Skilled Agricultural and Fishery Workers II
7 Craft and Related Trades Workers II
8 Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers II
9 Elementary Occupations I
The following changes occurred in NCO â 15 after it was aligned/mapped to ISCO â 2008:
ï· Updating job roles linked to the information and technology sector
ï· Expansion of job roles in the health sector
ï· Reorganization of job roles for clerks. This was again reorganized to reflect the rapid
growth of information and technology
VOLUME I 19
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
ï· Reorganization of job roles that fall under the categories of sales and service workers,
personal service workers , personal care workers, and protective services workers
ï· New Families were added to suit the national requirements
ï· Detailed categorization of job roles in information and services sector like tourism
ï· Division X â Workers not classified by Occupations were removed from NCO â 2015
classification
3. International Classification of Occupations
NCO â 2004 followed a six digit coding structure with a decimal after the first four digits. The first
four are single digit representation of Division, Sub-Division, Group, and Family respectively. The
last two digits of the code, after the decimal, denote the individual Occupation. NCO â 2004 was
based on ISCO â 1988 and it is almost a decade since it was updated. Meanwhile, ILO has also
published a revised version of ISCO in 2008. Many changes have taken place in the economic,
social, industrial, and agrarian fields and have resulted in creation of new jobs and functions in
the Indian labour market during this period.
In order to understand and incorporate the best practices across the world, five international
Occupational Classifications were studied along with NCO â 2004 as specified below:
1. International Labour Organization â International Standard Classification of Occupations
(ISCO)
2. United States of America â Standard Occupation Classification (SCO)
3. Australia & New Zealand â Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of
Occupations (ANZCO)
4. Germany â Klassifikation der Berufe (KlDB)
5. Canada â National Occupational Classification

Occupations, Major, Minor, and Unit Groups. This coding structure is quite similar to the ISCO
Coding Structure.
Sample Code Sample Code Title
9446 Industrial Sewing Machine Operators
VOLUME I 24
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
4. NCO â 2015 Coding Structure
There have been numerous changes in the international sphere, which have been captured in the
ISCO â 2008 and other international standards. It was necessary to review the coding structure of
NCO to accommodate the changing labour market environment in the country as well as globally.
This was done with the help of the National Competency Framework (NSQF), which is an
outcome-based approach and functions through the qualifications pack â QP NOS. Based on the
analysis of the abovementioned international classifications and the factors impacting skill and
labour environment in India, an enhanced framework for the NCO was created. This framework
incorporates the following:
ï· Type of occupation
ï· Skill level needed for the occupation
ï· Linkage to the QP NOS and NSQF levels
To accommodate the linkage to QP NOS, an 8 digit coding structure was suggested. An expert
committee was established to review and accept the suggested 8 digit coding structure for NCO â
2015. This coding structure was based on the NCO â 2004 coding structure mapped and aligned
to ISCO â 2008 with the addition of 2 digits, which will represent the QP NOS.
The coding structure of NCO â 2015 is as follows:
Coding Structure NCO â 2015 Digits Representation Corresponding Mapping to
ISCO â 2008
The first digit Division Major Group
The first two digits Sub-Division Sub-Major Group
The first three digits Group Minor Group
The first four digits Family Unit Group
The first two digits after the decimal Occupation
VOLUME I 25
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
The last two digits after the decimal QP NOS
ï· The first digit of NCO â 2015 will represent the Division (Major Group in ISCO)
ï· The first two digits of NCO â 2015 will represent the Sub-Division (Sub-Major Group in ISCO)
ï· The first three digits of NCO â 2015 will represent the Group (Minor Group in ISCO)
ï· The first four digits of NCO â 2015 will represent the Family (Unit Group in ISCO)
ï· A decimal is introduced after the first four digits in order to create a distinction between the
Families and individual Occupations.
ï· The first two digits after the decimal of NCO â 2015 will represent the different occupations
that can be combined under the given Family
ï· The last two digits after the decimal in NCO â 2015 shall represent the availability of a QP
NOS for the job role.
ï· The value of the last two digits would depend on two scenarios:
i. If QP NOS is available, then the value of the last 2 digits after the decimal will be
between1-99 (arranged sequentially)
ii. If QP NOS is unavailable, then the value of the last two digits after the decimal will remain
00
4.1 NCO 2015 â Illustration of the Code
An illustrative example of the proposed NCO â 2015 code is shown below for the code â
8153.0111 (Sewing Machine Operator, General):
Code: 8153.0111
Job Title: Sewing Machine Operator, General
8 Division In this example, â8â stands for the Division which is
Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers
81 Sub-Division 81 stands for the Sub-Division of the Occupation,
which is Stationary Plant and Machine Operators
815 Group 815 represents the Group under which the occupation
VOLUME I 26
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
falls, which is Textiles, Fur and Leather Products
Machine Operators
8153 Family 8153 denotes the Family under which the occupation
is listed, which is Sewing Machine Operators
8153.01 Occupation .011 indicates the Occupation under the given Family,
which is Sewing Machine Operator, General
8153.0111 Occupation 1 (the last digit in .0111) denotes the QP NOS
reference i.e. Sewing Machine Operator published by
QP NOS Reference
Apparel, Made-ups & Home Furnishing
Sample Code
The NCO â 2015 Coding Structure can accommodate 9999 Families. There can be a maximum of
99 Occupations under each Family. There can be a maximum of 99 QP NOS references per
Occupation.
Considering the dynamics of the labour market and addition of new QP NOS by the SSCs over a
period of time, the NCO â 2015 codes would be reviewed and updated periodically. This eight
digit coding structure provides ample scope for addition of Families or Occupations to the NCO, if
required, in the future.
4.2 Mapping the Job Roles to the Sectors/Industry
Once the job roles/occupations were mapped as per ISCO â 2008, they were also classified as per
the sector/industry in which they fit. This mapping will help the Career Counsellors to guide a
jobseeker in gaining the correct job as per the relevant sector. Thus, all the job roles in the newly
created NCO â 2015 were mapped to the relevant sectors. The data generated was then shared
with experts from the industries for validation.
4.2.1 Mapping the Job Roles to NIC
VOLUME I 27
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
Job roles in the NCO â 2015 are also mapped to the National Industrial Classification 2008 (NIC),
which is an essential statistical standard for developing and maintaining comparable database
according to economic activities.
NIC classifies the economic activities under three broad categories viz. primary production
(agriculture and mining), secondary production (manufacturing and construction), and services
(transport, commerce, administration, etc.)
The NIC â 2008 seeks to provide a basis for the standardized collection, analysis, and
dissemination of industry- (economic activity) wise economic data for India. Apart from being the
standard industrial classification, NIC is widely used by the government agencies, industry
associations, and researchers for various administrative, analytical, and research purposes. Thus
linking or mapping the NCO â 2015 would encompass not only the broad-based economic
activities, but also all the job roles that would be a part of these activities.
NIC â 2008 coding is based on economic activities under various sectors/industries. The activities
are broadly classified under various sectors/industries. This classification does not accommodate
every job role in a sector. Currently NIC â 2008 has 21 sections (A to U) corresponding to the
various sectors. All the NCO â 2015 Occupations have been classified as per sectors and mapped
to NIC â 2008. There are certain occupations that may feature in more than one sector. For
example, the occupation of Storyboard Artist (NCO â 2015 Code: 2166.0209), which has QP NOS
Reference of Media & Entertainment SSC - MES/Q0507, has employment prospect in multiple
economic activities such as activities of individual writers for all subjects including fictional
writing, technical writing, etc. (NIC 2008 Code: 90004), Publishing of computer games for all
platforms (NIC 2008 Code: 58203), and Video Production (NIC 2008 Code: 59112).
4.3 Classifying the Job Roles
NCO â 2015 defines and describes various occupations available in the country giving them
standard and alternative occupational titles. As per DG&ET, a job analysis of all job codes was
VOLUME I 28
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
essential. The task involved analysis of all job codes in terms of relevance and completeness, and
categorizing them in three groups namely:
ï· Relevant (R)
ï· Relevant with Modification (RM)
ï· Redundant/Obsolete (O)
It is observed that with time, some job codes have become irrelevant. The reason is that either
the job profiles do not exist due to changing requirements of the industry or they may require
certain modifications. A thorough study of all job codes was undertaken and each job code was
categorised as relevant, relevant with modification, and redundant/obsolete. The break-up of
each category is explained below:
R â All the previous codes that are relevant according to the current work practices and
environment to be marked as R (Relevant)
RM â All the previous codes that are relevant according to the current work practices and
environment, but with certain modification (like modification in job description,
modification/changes in the title, changes/modifications in skill level) to be marked as RM
(Relevant with Modification)
O â All the previous codes that are no longer relevant to the current work practices and
environment to be marked as O (Redundant/Obsolete).
Industry experts were consulted to review the NCO â 2015 job roles and validate the
categorization of NCO codes as R, RM, and O. The industry experts also validated the cases
wherein new codes have been proposed.
5. National Career Service Project (NCSP)
5.1 The National Career Service Project (NCSP)
VOLUME I 29
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
The aim of the Government is to ensure that the aspiring youth of India pursue the right career
choice. Keeping this in mind the main objective of the DGE&T is career counselling. Career
counselling will not only help the youth to choose the right job for them, but will also help with
better skills for enhancing growth and development. Taking this forward, DGE&T and
Government have taken-up the task of establishing a knowledge repository within the National
Career Service Project (NCSP). This knowledge repository shall act as a common, centralized
platform to provide career-related information to career counsellors and aspirants across the
country. This repository will not only store data, but will also link jobs with the appropriate
industrial sectors. Occupations listed and mapped under NCO â 2015 will act as the beginning
point of creating career content, which will then form a part of the knowledge repository of the
National Career Service (NCS) Portal.
The aim of the NCSP is:
ï· To provide gainful employment to all jobseekers registered with Employment Exchanges
ï· To facilitate interaction between jobseekers and employers
ï· To disseminate accurate and consistent employment market information to all
stakeholders on time
The NCSP, therefore, is a comprehensive and multipronged transformational project with the
following key aspects:
5.1.1 Model Career Centres (MCC)
The aim is to transform the current Employment Exchange Offices into Career Counselling
Centres. These career centres would serve as a one-stop-shop for all career related needs of the
youth and students seeking counselling and employment. These career centres shall undertake all
the activities related to NCSP i.e. establishing inter-linkages with industry for managing the
demand side while on the other hand providing counselling and job assistance services to the
supply side.
VOLUME I 30
National Classification of Occupations â 2015 Introduction
5.1.2 Developing a Network of Professional Career Counsellors
NCSP plans to establish a network of career counsellors. This will be done by transforming the
existing Employment Exchange Offices into Career Counselling Centres and also identifying other
institutions/agencies that can volunteer in the career counselling activities. The training of the
career counsellors will be undertaken by the Training wing of DGE&T.
5.1.3 National Career Service Portal Implementation
The National Career Service Portal will act as a platform to bridge the gap between the
government and private job providing ecosystem, jobseeker, and skill development ecosystem.
5.1.4 Maintenance of Knowledge Repository of Career Counselling Content
For Employment Exchange Officers to work effectively as Career Counsellors, they need to have
access to an updated knowledge repository of various career options and employment
opportunities. This content should be renewed on quarterly basis based on the feedback
