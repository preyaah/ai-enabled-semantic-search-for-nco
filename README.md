# AI-enabled Semantic Search for National Classification of Occupation (NCO)

## 1. Track
Data Collection and Processing

---

## 2. Description

The National Classification of Occupation (NCO) is a standardized system for classifying occupations in India, aligned with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). The current version, NCO-2015, includes detailed descriptions of 3,600 civilian occupations across 52 sectors, structured through an 8-digit hierarchical code.

**Current Challenges:**
- Requires exact keyword match
- Offers no semantic understanding of queries
- Demands extensive familiarity with the occupation taxonomy
- Is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable

**Example Problem:**  
To assign the occupation code for a "Sewing Machine Operator," a user must know its classification hierarchy across divisions and sub-groups without automation. This complexity can result in incorrect classification, leading to data quality issues that hinder policy planning and productivity.

## 3. Solution Overview

This project presents a revolutionary AI/ML application that transforms NCO code assignment through advanced semantic search capabilities. The solution addresses existing limitations by implementing intelligent text understanding and automated occupation matching.

**Core Features Implemented:**
- **Semantic Understanding**: Advanced NLP models that comprehend job descriptions beyond simple keyword matching
- **Intelligent Matching**: Returns top N matching occupation codes with confidence scores and semantic relevance ranking
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit web application for seamless user interaction
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 70%+ confidence scores for precise job classification
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-second response time for semantic search queries

**Technical Implementation:**
- Utilizes Sentence Transformers for generating semantic embeddings of NCO occupation data
- Implements FAISS for fast similarity search and efficient retrieval
- Features an enhanced search engine that processes natural language queries
- Provides a responsive web interface built with Streamlit framework

## 4. How the System Works

The solution transforms the traditional NCO code assignment process through a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Data Processing**: NCO-2015 data is converted into structured formats and semantic embeddings are created for all 3,600+ occupation descriptions
2. **Query Processing**: User-entered job descriptions are converted into semantic vectors using transformer models
3. **Similarity Search**: FAISS algorithms find the most semantically similar occupations from the NCO database
4. **Results Ranking**: Matches are ranked by semantic relevance with confidence percentages
5. **User Selection**: An intuitive interface allows users to select the most appropriate classification code
